# [UFOs analysis](https://summerginger.github.io/UFOs/)
JavaScript and HTML

## Overview of the analysis
The project is to build a table to hold and neatly displayed the data that users can search up. 
### The purpose
The purpose is to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings. It is built by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page.
## Results
There are five lists of the searching box displayed on the webpage. Event handler calls a function to filter the data; the end users can grabs in the input value and uses the filter method to get new table data based off the given input. Code is able to handle total 5 filters (date, city, state, country or shape) at once and the multi-filtered data is rendered back to the table. Examples are in the following image:

## Summary:
The drawback of this web page is that it can only interact with the data provided by Dana (journalist). To further advance the web development, we recommend two suggestions: the first one is creating a script link from online sources to get more info about UFOs than just in the USA.  The second one is to add a refresh button beside the filter research or under the filter lists, supporting a faster and more efficient user experience.
